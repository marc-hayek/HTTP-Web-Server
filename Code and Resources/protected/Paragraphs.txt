<p><strong><U>Paragraph 1:</U></strong></p>-<p>A web server can be referred to as either the hardware (the computer) or the software (the computer application) that helps to deliver content that can be accessed through the internet. Most people think a web server is just the hardware computer, but a web server is also referred to as the software computer application that is installed in the hardware computer. A web server is what makes it possible to be able to access content like web pages, or other data from anywhere as long as it is connected to the internet. The hardware part is what houses the content, while the software part is what makes the content accessible through the internet</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 2:</U></strong></p>-<p>The most common use of web servers are to host websites but there are other uses like data storage or for running enterprise applications. There are also different ways to request content from a web server. The most common request is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), but there are also other requests like the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 3:</U></strong></p>-<p>The primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages on the request to clients. This means delivery of HTML documents and any additional content that may be included by a document, such as images, style sheets and JavaScripts.</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 4:</U></strong></p>-<p>A client, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource, or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary memory, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 5:</U></strong></p>-<p>While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes a way of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 6:</U></strong></p>-<p>Many generic web servers also support server side scripting, e.g., Apache HTTP Server and PHP. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this functionality is used to create HTML documents on the fly as opposed to return fixed documents. This is referred to as dynamic and static content respectively. The former is primarily used for retrieving and/or modifying information in databases. The latter is, however, typically much faster and easily cached.</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 7:</U></strong></p>-<p>Web servers are not always used for serving the world wide web, rather they can also be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring and/or administrating the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer, since only a web browser is required (which by now is included with most operating systems).</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 8:</U></strong></p>-<p>In 1989 Tim Berners Lee proposed to his employer CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) a new project, which had the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. As a result of the implementation of this project, in 1990 Berners Lee wrote two programs:</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 9:</U></strong></p>-<p>Between 1991 and 1994 the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the World Wide Web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among lots of different social groups of people, first in scientific organizations, then in universities and finally in industry.</p>-<p>    </p>
<p><strong><U>Paragraph 10:</U></strong></p>-<p>In 1994 Tim BernersLee decided to constitute the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to regulate the further development of the many technologies involved (HTTP, HTML, etc.) through a standardization process.</p>-<p>    </p>
